# Typed Recompose


The type definition for [`recompose`](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose.git)

Let's [discuss](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose/issues/231)

You are welcome!

Fisrt, take a look at `index.d.ts` file. I've used `connect`'s definition 
from `react-redux` library for HOC.

Then at `test/test.tsx` you can see usage examples. Basically testing of 
annotations means «write your typical code samples and make sure that code compiles by `tsc`».
So if you see that provided annotation won't work in particular (still typical)
case, please let me know.
